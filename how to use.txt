How to start:
Run the RUN_ME.vbs script
Make sure the settings are how you want them
Click "Launch"

(of course, you can just run the client.py file, but that isn't as seamless)

Join a conversation:
In the bottom right, you will see your hostname. Give this to the person you want to talk to
Type the other person's hostname and then click "Submit". They will need to be running the client for this to work.
Leave the box empty to bring up the contacts window.
Once the window starts responding, you will be connected unless you see an error message
If you look in the server output box, you can see who is connected to you
You can connect to as many people as you want

Everything else should be labelled. Snake is under "More".
